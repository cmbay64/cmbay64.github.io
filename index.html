											<h2>Hi, I'm Cameron!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a senior computer science student at Le Moyne College. I also studied computer science and digital art at Clarkson University prior to Le Moyne. I value high quality art, design, and technology. With my BA in computer science and my experience with the three aforementioned areas of interest, I will be pursuing a career in software development post graduation. I believe that art and design mixed with technology can be a beautiful thing and I aim to continue making beautiful things with them.</p>
